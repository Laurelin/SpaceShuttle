<h2>Into SPACE </h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Build a spaceship, launch it, fly around/explore. No, I did not do anything other than launching here.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Accomplishment, fun with controls, discovery, epicness. 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Errr... right now, just action. Intended: strategy/survival/action
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>

Press spacebar to activate a Solid Rocket Booster(there are two). After the second, use arrow keys to move. 
Gravity and semi-accurate physics apply. Accelerate to really,really high velocities. 

there is no win condition. 

for maximum awesome, wait til narrator stops talking in the main menu to press play.

then wait for the second note of the horn call to press the first spacebar. wait until the narrator says 'Liftoff'
to press the spacebar again. 

win.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?

arcade physics(spaceship movement), game states, particle emitters. 

wish I had time for timer events and fine tuning some things.

</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Epic soundtrack of Epic

realistic shuttle launch

realistic physics

inability to lose
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
described earlier
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
none, yet.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
everyone. seriously.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1.50 min sec
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
careful about the acceleration/velocity
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Music is performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra, conducted by James Gardiner. Also Sprach Zarathustra is
conducted by Arie Kafar, no orchestra credit. Narration/engine noise is of the penultimate Atlantis Shuttle launch.

Main menu photo is from Nasa. Launch pad graphic cribbed from Nasa. All else is mine.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
??? Kerbal Space Program? I'm told I should go play that one.
</li>
